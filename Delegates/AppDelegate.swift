     The following instance variable is declared with the lazy attribute, i.e., lazy var,
     which is called a Lazy Stored Property, commonly referred to as lazy initialization,
     lazy instantiation, or lazy loading. This is a technique by which the creation of an
     object or a demanding process is delayed until it is really needed. This is helpful
     to better manage the efficient use of system resources.
    
     "Lazy properties are useful when the initial value for a property is dependent on
     outside factors whose values are not known until after an instance's initialization
     is complete. Lazy properties are also useful when the initial value for a property
     requires complex or computationally expensive setup that should not be performed
     unless or until it is needed." [Apple]
